Build a Bluetooth Android Plugin (from scratch) to communicate between android application A and android  application B.  - Application A should be data Sending application to Application B  - Application B should be data Receiving application from Application A  ii. Upload a sending data to AWS DynamoDB, while sending to Application B  iii. Upload a Receiving data to AWS DynamoDB, while Receiving from Application A
